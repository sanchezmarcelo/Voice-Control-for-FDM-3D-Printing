# Voice-Control-for-FDM-3D-Printing
An android application that allows a user to interface with a 3D printer using their voice.

With three prior years of experience working and building 3D printers, it's evident that the 3D printing community could benefit from a new interface: oneâ€™s voice. Hence, this project embarks towards creating software that can effectively transfer voice commands to a 3D printer.
